# Starbucks-Capstone-Challenge

My medium article to describe the work done in this data set: https://medium.com/@mohabyoussef09/predict-completing-an-offer-by-a-starbucks-customer-c17318c592c6?sk=2f7694ac5ef1e5680f3d43ea1ae66f0b

#Project Overview
Starbucks customers have a great option to get some offers during the week by downloading Starbucks mobile app. Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. In this article, some analysis will be done on the Starbucks customers and offers data to get some insights as well as building a model to predict if the customer will use the offer or not.

#Data
portfolio.json — containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
profile.json — demographic data for each customer
transcript.json — records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers complete
